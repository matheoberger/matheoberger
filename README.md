- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and gardening. I have completed two migrations of large services (Elasticsearch and Gemserver) from AWS to GCP. I also wrote an article on how to easily create a load balancer on Google Cloud. Additionally, I developed software to help people with permaculture gardening (Permaculture Sort).
