- 👋 Hi, I’m @matheoberger, I'm a DevOps engineering from Bordeaux, France.
- 👀 I’m interested into devops stuff and gardening, I already made two migrations of big services (elasticsearch and gemserver) from AWS to GCP. I also wrote an article about [how to easily create a load balancer on google cloud](https://blog.experteer.engineering/creating-an-internal-load-balancer-terraform-gcp.html).
      In another hand, I developped my software in order to help people doing some permaculture gardening ([permaculture sort](https://github.com/matheoberger/Permaculture-Sort-NodeJS-API)).
