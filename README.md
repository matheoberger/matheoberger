- 👋 Hi, I’m @matheoberger, a DevOps and backend engineer from Bordeaux, France.

- 👀 I’m interested into optimizing processes and learn how to secure them as much as I can. On my free time I'm developing Permasort, a website to help people with gardening plants associations.

- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and gardening. I have completed two migrations of large services (Elasticsearch and Gemserver) from AWS to GCP. I also wrote an article on how to easily create a load balancer on Google Cloud. Additionally, I developed software to help people with permaculture gardening (Permaculture Sort).
