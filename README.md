- 👋 Hi, I’m @matheoberger, a DevOps engineer from Bordeaux, France.

- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and gardening. I have completed two migrations of large services (Elasticsearch and Gemserver) from AWS to GCP. I also wrote an article on how to easily create a load balancer on Google Cloud. Additionally, I developed software to help people with permaculture gardening (Permaculture Sort).

- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m currently looking for a job, so feel free to reach out if you have any proposals!
